      Creating a blog website was an exciting venture, especially when the platform is designed to balance simplicity and functionality. My blog website focuses on user accessibility and creativity while implementing character limits for conciseness. The website allows users to compose, read, and manage blogs seamlessly through a responsive interface.
      <br />
      <br />
      The website provides a dedicated section for creating posts. Each post requires a title (up to 35 characters) and a body (up to 240 characters). These constraints encourage users to express their ideas succinctly, fostering concise and impactful writing. Additionally, the character limits help maintain the readability and visual appeal of the posts.

      <br />
      Once published, posts are displayed dynamically in the "Posts" section. Each blog includes a title, body, and a unique identifier for easy tracking. Users can interact with posts using intuitive buttons to view, edit, or delete them. The "Edit" feature allows users to update their content, ensuring that their ideas remain relevant and polished. Meanwhile, the "Delete" option facilitates post management by letting users remove outdated or unnecessary content.

      The website's layout is simple yet modern. A transparent black background enhances readability, and the consistent styling ensures a cohesive user experience. Forms for composing and editing posts are straightforward, guiding users with placeholder text and clear labels.
      <br />
      <br />
      Built with EJS templating, the platform dynamically updates content based on user interactions. For instance, when users create or edit posts, the changes are immediately reflected on the website. This real-time interaction ensures an engaging experience.
      <br />
      <br />
      In conclusion, this blog website serves as a platform for creativity, offering tools to write, edit, and manage concise blog posts effectively. Its focus on simplicity, functionality, and user engagement makes it a versatile and user-friendly solution for aspiring writers.
